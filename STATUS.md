# Status

Present-tense operational truth for `@kinra/web`. See
[`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) for the release gate and
[`docs/adoption.md`](docs/adoption.md) for the full consumer contract and
adoption map; this file only tracks current state, not process.

## Release

- Latest immutable tag: `v0.4.0` (2026-10-10, Kinra Mono and grid hairlines;
  release explicitly authorized by Blake). `package.json` and both root
  lockfile versions match the tag. The authored notes name the added face and
  the changed monospace default; consumer upgrades remain separate.
- Prior releases: `v0.3.0` (2026-10-05, design-system expansion and Space
  refresh; coordinated release authorized by Blake), `v0.2.0` (2026-08-16,
  Graphite+ alignment with Kinra Site; approved by Blake) and `v0.1.0`
  (`7a367ac`).
- A release is a tag, not a deployment: no build output, host, route, or
  registry publication sits behind it, so this repository owns no deploy
  command. Each consumer deploys its own site from the version it pins.

## Development

- `main` contains the released design-system expansion and refresh: a paper
  scheme beside graphite, serif and sans voices beside mono, type roles,
  layout compositions, generic control, navigation, feedback, overlay, and
  data components, five surface recipes, a source-owned candidate registry,
  and a twelve-page reference catalog with a scheme switch. The refresh changes
  several defaults (square marks, sentence-case eyebrow, more open tracking,
  serif editorial display); the migration notes live in `docs/adoption.md`.
- The polish pass refines paper contrast, small text, control geometry,
  hover and focus states, responsive specimens, and reduced-motion feedback.
  Reference-only collection, preferences, and review examples demonstrate
  the shared styles together without adding registry or stable contracts.
- The coordinated review released the expansion as `0.3.0`.
- Kinra Mono comes from Kinra Type `v0.1.0`, tagged on its `cf5bda4` commit.
  Blake approved the release and this adoption on 2026-10-10. The variable
  woff2 and `OFL.txt` are copied unchanged from that build into
  `assets/fonts/`. `src/styles/tokens.css` declares the face, and
  `--kin-font-mono` names it first. It is released as `0.4.0`, and consumers
  keep their pins until they upgrade.
- Kinra Sans and Kinra Serif come from the same `v0.1.0` build (2026-10-10):
  the upright and italic variable woff2 of each, copied unchanged beside Mono
  in `assets/fonts/` and declared in `tokens.css`. `--kin-font-sans` and
  `--kin-font-serif` name them first. This is committed on `main` and
  unreleased: Blake has not yet reviewed it on the reference pages, and a
  release (`0.5.0`) waits for his approval.
- `0.4.0` also carries the grid hairlines (`data-rules="between"`), a chosen
  row drawn as a tint alone, table text aligned to the line's start, keyboard
  hints kept at the smallest text size, and a closed disclosure's arrow kept
  down inside an open one.
- The corner key refresh is brought back from Kinra Space at
  `8589b8a5b04f771b5ab0a3b7b4d3fb38d66d2663` (2026-09-30): soft layer roles,
  wells and quiet controls, sentence-case labels, signal edges, and causal
  motion tokens now live in the shared styles. The corner action, corner key,
  and live edge are candidate registry patterns with Space's evidence; none
  is promoted before a second consumer. `/refresh/` demonstrates both grounds,
  all key faces without script, and interactive motion. The grammar, source
  boundary, and adoption state live in [`docs/refresh-plan.md`](docs/refresh-plan.md).
- The second Space polish port uses `0550b0e` (2026-10-01): compact touch
  controls, paragraph rhythm, rounded notice/toast edges, RTL disclosures and
  dialog spacing/focus are shared. Space verifies its exact consumer upgrade;
  all three registry patterns remain candidates. Release identity,
  tagging and other consumer upgrades remain separate.
- Depth for what floats comes from Kinra Space's decision 0078 (2026-10-03):
  an edge of its own tone (`--kin-float-ring`) and a short shadow, black on
  graphite. Foundations shows it on both grounds and on pure black. Space
  verifies its exact consumer upgrade; Site and Gateway keep their pins.
- `docs/brand.md` settles naming and marking (2026-09-11, Blake): one brand,
  Kin as the one unprefixed name, every product marked by `.kin-lockup`. The
  product wordmarks and the Facet mark are removed from `assets/`; Kinra
  Spaces replaces its wordmark with the lockup on its next upgrade. Kin's
  terminal welcome has one reviewed exception (2026-09-11, Blake): a compact
  cell rendering of the shared K, with live product text. Kinra Space has
  the one appointed product wordmark (2026-09-13, Blake, PP-0029):
  `assets/wordmark-space.svg`, the wordmark continued by `.␣` on its grid.

## Adoption

- **kinra-site** and **kinra-gateway** consume the public GitHub codeload
  archive at `21327ae489243316988019e6b6ca9a7737982699`, with lockfile
  integrity.
- **kinra-space** pins an exact GitHub Git dependency, including its
  appointed wordmark. Its package and lockfile own the current commit; its
  source gate and visual comparisons verify each upgrade.
- **Kin** and **Scope** retain exact brand assets from `21327ae`; these are
  source copies recorded in their owning vendored manifests.
- Retired Spaces and Kinra OS pins, and retiring Depot's vendored copy,
  remain recovery evidence in their owners. Current consumer pins predate
  `v0.3.0`; adoption follows each owner’s deliberate upgrade.

## Open for the release review

- The package name `@kinra/web` predates the brand standard and undersells
  what the repository now owns. Renaming it, likely to `@kinra/design`,
  changes every consumer's import paths and Gateway's build banner. The `0.3.0`
  and `0.4.0` releases keep `@kinra/web`; a later rename requires its own
  coordinated migration.

## Next event

Upgrade consumers to a verified release, `v0.4.0` being the latest, in their
owning repositories. Candidate registry promotion still requires a second
consumer. Review Kinra Sans and Kinra Serif on the reference pages, then
release them as `0.5.0` on Blake's approval; Kinra Mono is released.
